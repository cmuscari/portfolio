# Professional Portfolio

## Description
This web page is a portfolio of my work that can showcase my skills and talents to potential employers.  It includes images / links to several of my strongest projects, a bio section with photo, as well as my contact information.  Areas of focus at this time: basic structure and style of page, as well as using flexbox, media queries & css variables.
